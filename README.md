# Image Encryption Tool

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Encryption Tool, a project developed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy! This simple tool allows you to perform image encryption using pixel manipulation. You can swap pixel values or apply basic mathematical operations to each pixel, providing a customizable and secure method for encrypting and decrypting images.

## Features

- **Pixel Swapping:** Swap pixel values within the image for a unique encryption technique.
  
- **Mathematical Operations:** Apply basic mathematical operations to each pixel, enhancing the encryption process.

- **Encryption and Decryption:** The tool supports both encryption and decryption processes, ensuring secure image manipulation.

## How to Use the Tool

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-encryption-tool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd image-encryption-tool
   ```

3. **Run the Tool:**
   Execute the Python script to run the Image Encryption Tool:
   ```bash
   python image_encryption_tool.py
   ```

4. **Select Operation:**
   Choose the desired operation from the menu - pixel swapping, mathematical operation, encryption, or decryption.

5. **Input Image and Parameters:**
   Provide the tool with the image file path and any additional parameters required for the selected operation.

6. **View the Result:**
   The tool will display the result of the chosen operation and save the encrypted or decrypted image accordingly.
